# Blood-Bank-Management
The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is designed to streamline the administration of blood banks by allowing administrators to manage donor records, track blood inventory, and handle blood requests efficiently. 
The system includes functionalities for updating donor and request statuses, viewing detailed records (such as blood type, donation history, and eligibility), and generating reports for different periods (such as daily donations or current stock levels). It utilizes Python with Flask for backend operations, Jinja2 for templating, and a responsive front-end built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Security is ensured through session-based authentication, allowing only authorized users to access sensitive data. The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing blood bank operations and offers insightful data visualizations to support better decision-making in healthcare management.

Objective: The objective of the Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is to automate and simplify the management of blood donations and requests. The system aims to provide a centralized platform for tracking blood inventory, registering donors, and handling blood requests based on priority. It ensures accurate record-keeping, reduces manual errors, and supports real-time data access. By integrating a responsive user interface, dynamic charts, and secure session control, BBMS enhances operational efficiency and enables healthcare providers to make timely, informed decisions.
